Problem : The analogy is based upon a hypothetical barber shop with one barber. There is a barber shop which has one barber, one barber chair, and n chairs for waiting for customers if there are any to sit on the chair.

If there is no customer, then the barber sleeps in his own chair.
When a customer arrives, he has to wake up the barber.
If there are many customers and the barber is cutting a customerâ€™s hair, then the remaining customers either wait if there are empty chairs in the waiting room or they leave if no chairs are empty.
